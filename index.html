<p>My name is Michael Cordoba. I am a student at the University of Florida completing my masters in Information Systems and Operations Management. I have made this page to display some of my experience, projects and hobbies. Feel free to reach out to me: mikeful92 AT hotmail DOT com.</p>

<p>While there are many things that I enjoy in life such as the outdoors, beach, reading, drawing, running, and swimming, there are three things that I consider my passions in life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Problem Solving</li>
  <li>Computers</li>
  <li>People</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fixing the world, one (small) problem at a time.</h3>

<p>When people ask me the dreaded "What/who are you?" the first thing that always come to mind is what I like to tackle my life. 
I had to develop an elevator pitch at my last internship. It goes something like this: "I am a problem solver that likes to think outside the box. 
After finding all the possible solutions I focus on efficiency and picking the optimal solution."
My mindset is that every problem that can broken down into smaller pieces. 
These smaller pieces can then be analyse in various ways and broken-down again.
At this point you have something that you can actually handle. When there is a problem in front of me I attempt to find every possible way to solve it. 
Even things that seem crazy or silly are taken into consideration no matter how unlikely. Once I have a list of solutions the hardest part starts, what is the best solution. 
Every problem will have different parameters for what "best" is. Whether that is cost savings, benefit maximization or other constraints. But I strongly believe that the optimal solution is out there.   </p>

<h3>
<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computers, video games and programmings.</h3>

<p> I will never forget when my dad bought his first company computer. I sat in front of the monitor with that very memorable windows 98 loading screen. I do not remember how much I messed with his computer,
but this was the moment that I fell in love with computers. My next step was when my parents let me build my first PC when I was 13. We did not have a lot of money at the time but they were willing to invest
on me learning a new skill. I spent weeks analyzing my build, making sure every part was compatible with the other, reading reviews on the graphics card, and picking the coolest tower. The PC tower had a clear side panel
so you could see all the parts and LEDs inside the motherboard. When the parts arrived my biggest worry was that one of the parts would not work. It took me a couple hours to read all the instructions and put
everything together. When the moment of truth came the PC did not boot. I went back to the manuals, read some online help and to my pride and joy the computer boot on the second try. Ever since I have been trying to
learn everything I can about technology. Taught myself C, C++, C#, VBA, SQL, and my personal favorite Python. I have designed a couple sites such as this while learning HTML, CSS and PHP. My latest projects are involving cyber risk
security, learning more on networks, program vulnerability, and penetration attacks. The learnign is never ending and I am excited to keep going.   </p>

<p> Thank you for visiting my site. Hope you reach out to me. </p>
